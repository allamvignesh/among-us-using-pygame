To make a LAN multiplayer game called among us using python’s
graphics engine pygame.

Among us is a RPG (Role Playing Game) multiplayer game. The
original game was made by Innersloth. It was a top trending game on
twitch.tv and YouTube in 2020. The game relies on players mind. This
simple game attracted a lot of players around the world.
Space travel, betrayal, murder, maintenance. These are just a few
exciting elements involved in among us. Solving the murder mystery
and winning is the main aim of the crew. Killing the crew is the main
aim of the imposter. The crew must perform various tasks to win. There
are few resources that the players can interact with to find the most
suspicious player. There is none that the players can trust in this game.
The main map here is “the skeld”. It is a spaceship that is on its
way to predestined location. The map has various rooms. The tasks are
located in the rooms. The overall shape of the map is a turtle-shaped.
There are few moving parts in the map, to make that much more
interesting.
Among us has been around for a while now. This game is an
inspiration from among us. Even though it is not fully functional like
among us. It like the development stages of the game. The language
used to make this game is python. Python is a quite simple language,
but can do some amazing stuff. Pygame library was used here. It is
python graphics library that uses C and Assembly code for core
functions. This library was designed to be used for making games.
