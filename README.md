# Among US - The Game
#### Made using python & pygame
##### This game was made as part of my school project in 2021.
#
> Space travel, betrayal, murder, maintenance. These are just a few exciting elements involved in among us. Solving the murder mystery and winning is the main aim of the crew. Killing the crew is the main aim of the imposter. The crew must perform various tasks to win. There are few resources that the players can interact with to find the most suspicious player. There is none that the players can trust in this game

#### Things to do
- Most of functions are reuseable but they are overlapping.
- Lots of repetition of code.
- Fix infinite vision.
- Tasks must overlay the game.
- sockets are buggy.
